# Broken code
The code in this directory contains compilation errors or exhibits behavior that deviates significantly from what would be expected. It was decided to keep it this way because it serves as a reminder of an earlier time. The code is quite old, from a period when the team was still learning to program, and no best practices were applied, as that knowledge had not yet been acquired.

In short, the code here is more of a memory than something truly useful. ðŸ˜Š
