# Prototypes
Below is the code used for learning purposes, aimed at discovering new methods and libraries for creating prompt interfaces and developing game logic, such as snake movement and apple collection.
>Note: We didn't know how to use Git or other version control systems at the time, so each new version was a different project (❁´◡`❁).
